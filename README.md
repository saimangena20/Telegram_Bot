# Telegram Bot

A simple Telegram bot powered by Google's Gemini AI API.  
Built with **Python**, **pyTelegramBotAPI**, and **google-generativeai**.
This is a Telegram bot that uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate responses to both text and voice messages. The bot uses Google Speech Recognition to convert voice messages to text, and pyttsx3 to convert responses to speech. It also summarizes long responses before sending them back.
